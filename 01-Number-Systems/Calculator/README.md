# Number System Conversion Calculator

This mini project is developed as part of the **Digital Logic Circuits – Number Systems** module.
It demonstrates practical implementation of number system conversions using programming.

## Features
- Decimal to Binary
- Decimal to Octal
- Decimal to Hexadecimal
- Binary to Decimal
- Octal to Decimal
- Hexadecimal to Decimal
- Inter-conversions using decimal as an intermediate base

## Concepts Applied
- Positional representation of numbers
- General radix (r) number system
- Conversions between number systems
- Base-r arithmetic

## Implementation Details
- Programming Language: Python
- Menu-driven console application
- Uses built-in base conversion logic for clarity and correctness
